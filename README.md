## Looking for more performance?
The company managing this repo created the SWARM Developer System to help build, simulate and deploy single and
multi-agent autonomous systems. Check it out here: [SWARM Developer System](https://www.swarmsim.io/overview/developer)
  
## IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
Moving forward, we are now using Unreal Engine 5 version 5.03 or greater! If you
want to use UE4.27, you can use the branch `ue4.27`.
  
## Unreal Engine Version for Main Branch
The main branch of this repository **only** supports Unreal Engine 5.2! Please see our other branches
for other versions that we support.
  
## Currently Supported Operating Systems
Below are the list of officially supported Operating Systems, with full Unreal Engine support:
### Windows
- Windows 10 (Latest)

### Linux
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 20.04
  
**NOTE** Ubuntu 22.04 is not currently supported due to Vulkan support. If this changes, we will notify you here. If you want to use Colosseum on 22.04, we highly recommend that you use Docker.

### MacOS (Non-M1 Macs only)
- MacOS Monterey (12)
- MacOS (11)
  
**NOTE** MacOS support is highly experimental and may be dropped in future releases. This is because Apple continually changes their build tools and doesn't like 3rd party developers in general. There are ongoing discussions to remove this support.

## Introduction
  
Colosseum is a simulator for robotic, autonomous systems, built on [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) (we now also have an experimental [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. Similarly, we have an experimental release for a Unity plugin.
  
This is a fork of the AirSim repository, which Microsoft decided to shutdown in July of 2022. This fork serves as a waypoint to building a new and better simulation platform. The creater and maintainer of this fork is Codex Laboratories LLC (our website is [here](https://www.codex-labs-llc.com)). Colosseum is one of the underlying simulation systems that we use in our product, the [SWARM Simulation Platform](https://www.swarmsim.io). This platform exists to provide pre-built tools and low-code/no-code autonomy solutions. Please feel free to check this platform out and reach out if interested.

## How to Use It

### Documentation

View our [detailed documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/) on all aspects of Colosseum.

### Manual drive

If you have remote control (RC) as shown below, you can manually control the drone in the simulator. For cars, you can use arrow keys to drive manually.

[More details](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/remote_control)

### Programmatic control

Colosseum exposes APIs so you can interact with the vehicle in the simulation programmatically. You can use these APIs to retrieve images, get state, control the vehicle and so on. The APIs are exposed through the RPC, and are accessible via a variety of languages, including C++, Python, C# and Java.

These APIs are also available as part of a separate, independent cross-platform library, so you can deploy them on a companion computer on your vehicle. This way you can write and test your code in the simulator, and later execute it on the real vehicles. Transfer learning and related research is one of our focus areas.

Note that you can use [SimMode setting](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/settings#simmode) to specify the default vehicle or the new [ComputerVision mode](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/image_apis#computer-vision-mode-1) so you don't get prompted each time you start Colosseum.

[More details](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis)

### Gathering training data

There are two ways you can generate training data from Colosseum for deep learning. The easiest way is to simply press the record button in the lower right corner. This will start writing pose and images for each frame. The data logging code is pretty simple and you can modify it to your heart's content.

![record screenshot](docs/images/record_data.png)

A better way to generate training data exactly the way you want is by accessing the APIs. This allows you to be in full control of how, what, where and when you want to log data.

### Computer Vision mode

Yet another way to use Colosseum is the so-called "Computer Vision" mode. In this mode, you don't have vehicles or physics. You can use the keyboard to move around the scene, or use APIs to position available cameras in any arbitrary pose, and collect images such as depth, disparity, surface normals or object segmentation.

[More details](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/image_apis)

### Weather Effects

Press F10 to see various options available for weather effects. You can also control the weather using [APIs](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis#weather-apis). Press F1 to see other options available.
